** This is a sample command file for the Anteater BandB, Stage IV
** First, add some bedrooms:
NB 101
NB 102
NB 103
** Now make some reservations:
RR 101 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 Claude Crillon
RR 102 12/31/2012  1/5/2013 Donald Dorchester
** Try a few reservations that go backwards in time:
RR 103 11/3/2012 12/15/1989 Bonnie Bonaventure
RR 103 12/17/2012 11/18/2012 Osamu Okura
RR 103 12/31/2012 12/25/2012 Penelope Peninsula
** And one that comes and goes on the same date:
RR 103 12/1/2012 12/1/2012 Randolph Raffles
LR
** Now try some conflicting reservations
** One that overlaps exactly:
rr 101 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 George Cinq
** One that overlaps a couple of days:
rr 102 12/25/2012  1/1/2013 Renata Rossiya
** One that's completely contained:
rr 102 1/1/2013 1/3/2013 Mark Hopkins
** And one that doesn't conflict, barely:
rr 102 12/25/2012 12/31/2012 Belle Air
LR
** Now try to add an already-existing bedroom:
NB 103
** Finally, delete a bedroom (which cancels all its reservations):
db 102
rr 103 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 Alfreda Algonquin
PL The final list of reservations:
