**PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SAMPLE INPUTS WRITTEN BY DAVID KAY

The Anteater Bed and Breakfast is a program that keeps track of reservations
at "AntBnB", a small "bed and breakfast" hotel.

UCI has just started a program in hotel and restaurant management; 
its dean has established a small "bed and breakfast" hotel as a lab for the program's students. 
The dean has asked you to write the reservations software for this new inn, 
which will be called the Anteater BandB.



NOTE: David Kay intended output to be written to a file, but my program prints
to the console.
