**PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SAMPLE INPUTS WRITTEN BY DAVID KAY

The Anteater Bed and Breakfast is a program that keeps track of reservations
at "AntBnB", a small "bed and breakfast" hotel.

UCI has just started a program in hotel and restaurant management; 
its dean has established a small "bed and breakfast" hotel as a lab for the program's students. 
The dean has asked you to write the reservations software for this new inn, 
which will be called the Anteater BandB.


NB
  (for "add a new bedroom") followed by an integer room number (in the range 1â€“999). Add a new bedroom with the specified room number.
LB
  (for "list bedrooms"). Print a list of the bedrooms currently available. The input file may contain any number of these commands in any 
  order; each LB command prints a list of available bedrooms based on what has been added as of that point. See the sample output below for 
  the format of the printed bedroom list. For this stage, it doesn't matter what order the bedrooms appear in.

PL
  (for "print line"), followed by any text. Simply print (or "echo") a line, copying the input (not counting the PL and leading whitespace) 
  to the output. You'll find it useful in testing, and it's also a simple way to make the program's reports clearer or fancier.
  
**
  Comment, followed by any text. Like comments in a program, comment lines don't have any effect on the program's behavior; they just serve 
  as annotations in the command file.


NOTE: David Kay intended output to be written to a file, but my program prints
to the console.
